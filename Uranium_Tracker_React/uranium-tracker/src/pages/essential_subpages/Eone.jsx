It is a dense, metallic element that plays a crucial role in the nuclear industry due to its unique properties, particularly its ability to sustain nuclear fissionâ€”a process where the nucleus of an atom splits into two smaller nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy. This ability makes uranium the lime2 fuel used in nuclear reactors and a key material in nuclear weapons."
