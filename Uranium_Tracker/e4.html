                Uranium is naturally occurring and can be found in various types
                of igneous rocks, which are formed through the cooling and
                solidification of molten magma or lava. The concentration and
                distribution of Uranium within these rocks depend on the
                conditions under which they formed, including the composition of
                the magma, the rate of cooling, and the geological setting.
                Below are the key details about Uranium's occurrence in igneous
                rocks: Pegmatites, which are coarse-grained igneous rocks, may
                also host Uranium-bearing minerals.
              </li>
              <li class="text-white/45 text-[15px] p-1">
                Granites are among the most common igneous rocks on Earth and
                are known to contain higher concentrations of Uranium compared
                to other rock types. Uranium in granites typically occurs in the
                mineral uraninite (UO2), but it can also be found in zircon,
                monazite, and other accessory minerals.
              </li>
              <li class="text-white/45 text-[15px] p-1">
                The concentration of Uranium in granites generally ranges from 2
                to 20 parts per million (ppm), but it can be higher in some
                specialized types of granites known as "high-heat-producing
                granites," which are significant in geothermal energy research.
              </li>
              <li class="text-white/45 text-[15px] p-1">
                Granites form deep within the Earth's crust, typically in
                tectonically active regions where magma slowly cools and
                solidifies. The slow cooling allows for the crystallization of
                minerals, including those that host Uranium.
              </li>
              <li class="text-white/45 text-[15px] p-1">
                Uranium-enriched granitic rocks are often associated with
                continental crust regions, especially in areas where ancient
                geological processes have concentrated heavy elements.

                Pegmatites are coarse-grained igneous rocks that typically form
                in the final stages of magma crystallization. They are often
                enriched in rare minerals, including those containing Uranium.
              </li>
              <li class="text-white/45 text-[15px] p-1">
                The large crystal sizes in pegmatites, which can sometimes reach
                several meters in length, are due to the slow cooling of magma.
                This slow cooling allows for the segregation and concentration
                of elements like Uranium.

              <li class="text-white/45 text-[15px] p-1">
                In pegmatites, Uranium is commonly found in minerals such as
                uraninite, as well as in secondary minerals like autunite,
                torbernite, and gummite, which form through the alteration of

              <li class="text-white/45 text-[15px] p-1">
                Uranium in alkaline rocks is usually associated with complex
                mineral assemblages, including eudialyte, pyrochlore, and

                Sandstone-hosted deposits are among the most important types of
                Uranium deposits, particularly in terms of economic viability.
                These deposits are formed when Uranium-bearing fluids migrate
                through porous and permeable sandstone layers and precipitate
                Uranium minerals under reducing conditions.

                Uranium is initially leached from source rocks (often granitic
                rocks) by oxidizing groundwater. As the groundwater percolates
                through the Earth's crust, it transports the dissolved Uranium
                into sandstone formations.

                When this Uranium-bearing fluid encounters reducing conditions,
                often provided by organic material, sulfides, or other
                reductants, the Uranium precipitates out of solution, forming
                minerals like uraninite and coffinite within the sandstone

                Regions with an arid or semi-arid climate often have significant

                Uranium can also be concentrated in organic-rich sedimentary
                layers such as lignite (brown coal) and coal beds. These
                deposits form when Uranium-bearing groundwater interacts with
                organic material, which acts as a reducing agent, causing the
                Uranium to precipitate and accumulate in the sediment.

              <li class="text-white/45 text-[15px] p-1">
                As groundwater percolates through coal beds or lignite seams,
                Uranium is reduced and precipitated by the organic matter, often

                The organic material within coal beds provides the necessary

                Phosphorite deposits, which are marine sedimentary rocks rich in
                phosphate minerals, can contain significant concentrations of
                Uranium. These deposits are formed in shallow marine
                environments where phosphate precipitates from seawater and
                accumulates on the seafloor.

                The Uranium content in phosphorites can vary but typically
                ranges from 50 to 200 ppm. However, in some cases, it can be

                Unconformity-related deposits are some of the richest and most

                The unconformity acts as a structural trap, focusing fluid flow

                Uranium deposits, while generally lower grade compared to other

                Evaporite deposits form in closed basins where water from rivers
                or groundwater accumulates and evaporates, leaving behind a
                concentration of dissolved minerals, including Uranium. These
                deposits are often associated with saline environments, such as
                playas, salt flats, or evaporitic lakes.

                The formation of Uranium minerals in these environments is
                similar to that in calcrete deposits, but they are often found

                gypsum, and anhydrite.

                Paleochannels are ancient, buried river channels that have been
                filled with sediment over time. In some cases, these channels
                can host surficial Uranium deposits, particularly in regions
                where groundwater has transported and concentrated Uranium

                Surficial paleochannel deposits form when Uranium-bearing water

                environments within the channel.

                These deposits can be identified by geophysical methods, such as

                fluids responsible for this mineralization are often derived
